** Experiment 1
- Predict the DEP_DELAY_GROUP, then 
- multiply the predicted values by 15 minutes and 
- calculate the evaluation metrics based on the true value in DEP_DELAY
- At the end, compare metrics with the direct DEP_DELAY regressor and
- Make a conclusion on which one is better
--> Done: looks slightly better with mixed regressor

** Experiment 2
- replace all delays larget than 180 minutes with the mean of delays larger than 180
- replace all early departure lower than -120 with the mean of delays lower than 120
- Train an xgboost regressor based on DEP_DELAY
- Evaluate 
- Make a conclusion on which one is better
--> done

** Final Experiment
- Pick the model with best performance
- Tune the model and
- Train it on training dataset 2022
- Tested on testing dataset 2023
--> done
