** Experiment 1
- Predict the DEP_DELAY_GROUP, then 
- multiply the predicted values by 15 minutes and 
- calculate the evaluation metrics based on the true value in DEP_DELAY
- At the end, compare metrics with the direct DEP_DELAY regressor and
- Make a conclusion on which one is better

** Experiment 2
- Predict the DEP_DELAY_GROUP, then
- Segment the dataset according to these predicted groups
- Build and evaluate a regressor based on DEP_DELAY for each model
- plot the results in a histogram
- Compare to previous models and 
- Make a conclusion on which one is better

** Final Experiment
- Pick the model with best performance
- Tune the model and
- Train it on training dataset 2022
- Tested on testing dataset 2023
